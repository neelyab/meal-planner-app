# Meal Planner App

## About
The meal planner app is a full stack application that helps two people find recipes that suit two different diets and plan their meals. Upon creating an account, the user is able to search for recipes and save these recipes to their own customized meal plans. The app uses Edamam's recipe API for the recipes and an API built from scratch for user info and saved recipes.
